# PROTO files for a TTS text preprocessing service

These proto files define messages and services for a TTS text preprocessing pipeline.

The pipeline consists of text cleaning, with the possibility of an up front html-parsing and text extraction, text normalization,
spell correction, insertion of pause tags through phrasing, and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (g2p).

In `generate_proto.sh` there is an example script for the generation of Python code for the proto files (`_pb2.py` and `_pb2_grpc.py`) but generation normally takes place in the project using the protos.
